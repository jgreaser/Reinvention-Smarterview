This is called capillary action. Capillary action is caused by water molecules sticking together and traveling upwards through narrow tubes. This is an important property for plants like dune grasses and mangroves that rely on capillary action to bring water and nutrients from the ground up to their leaves. Without capillary action plant life would not exist.\"}}]}",

You go to bed one hour early and see what happens. \\n\\nSTEP 5: ANALYSIS\\nAfter the experiment it's time for analysis, where you record the results of your experiment. Did going to bed one hour earlier make getting up easier: yes or no?\\n\\nSTEP 6: CONCLUSION\\nThe conclusion is where you review your data and compare it to your hypothesis. If going to bed one hour earlier made waking up easier, then your experiment worked! If not, it's back to the drawing board to come up with another hypothesis--maybe this time you predict that going to bed 2 hours earlier might help, or cutting off screen time before bed. \\n\\nAs you can see, the scientific method provides an organized way to keep track of how to solve a problem or question. \"}}]}",

Religion was very important to the New England settlers and they were driven more by their spiritual goals than by their economic interests.  However, the New England economy was based on lumber to build ships due to the vast forests in the region. Next, let's visit the Middle Colonies and take a look at their culture and economy.  The Middle Colonies were comprised of a diverse group of religions such as the Quakers and the Lutherans and they all tolerated each other. Religion was an important part of the community.  Due to the mild climate and fertile soil of the middle colonies most farmers grew enough for their family and even more.  They grew a lot of wheat and grain.  The middle colonies were known as the \\\"breadbasket' of the 13 colonies. Finally let's take our journey to look at the culture and economy of the Southern colonies.  Religion in the Southern colonies was not practiced with the enthusiasm that was in New England. The Southerners put more faith in their tobacco plantations. Tobacco was one of their greatest cash crops. Growing tobacco required a large labor force and the owners relied on slave labor to produce lots of tobacco.  Finally this wraps up the journey through the three groups of colonies. And we can now see all of the cultural and economic differences between the New England The Middle and the Southern colonies.  \"}}]}",

You will want to scan the expression and identify any like terms.  The first like terms we see are the 10x and -6x. To combine these two terms we would do 10 - 6, which is equal to 4. Therefore, 10x - 6x = 4x.  The next like terms we see are the 7y and 8y. To combine these two terms we would do 7 + 8, because the 8y is positive. 7 + 8 is 15, therefore 7y + 8y = 15y.  The last two like terms we see are 5z and -11z. Here, we will want to do 5 - 11 which is -6. Therefore, 5z - 11z = -6z.  Now that we have combined like terms, the simplified expression will be: 4x + 15y - 6z.\\n\\nDoes it matter what order we write the expression in? The answer is no! As long as you keep the sign in front of each term. We can rewrite this expression as: 15y - 6z + 4x or -6z + 4x + 15y.\"}}]}",

We\u2019re going to start with this big fancy camera here, and this is an SLR camera. It\u2019s actually a DSLR, the D standing for digital. The SLR part stands for Single Lens Reflex- and what that means is that what you see comes in through the single lens and goes into the camera body where the is a series of mirrors where the image reflects- get it? Reflects-reflex?- into the optical viewfinder where you see the picture. What this means is that what you see and the picture you take are the very same thing. It was a pretty big advance at the time. The other thing that\u2019s great about an SLR type camera is that they\u2019re really versatile. You can actually take off that single lens and switch it out for another type of lens, like these. So different lenses can be for different purposes or subjects, and so a telephotos lens like this is great if you are taking a picture of something that\u2019s really far away. Now I\u2019m going to hold up this SLR again so you can appreciate the difference in size between an SLR and a point and shoot- pretty obvious, isn\u2019t it? A point and shoot is great because it\u2019s compact, and easy to carry with you. It doesn\u2019t\u2019 have all those mirrors on the inside like the SLRs so they can make the camera a lot smaller. Now I\u2019m going to do something tricky here, I\u2019m going to switch to a different camera and I\u2019ll tell you why. I\u2019m going to show you this really old camera- it\u2019s actually so old that it\u2019s a film camera! But what I want to show you is that the original type of point and shoot camera have two lenses so they have that lens that takes the picture but they also have a second lens here that you see through. This is what helped eliminate the bigger camera body because you don\u2019t need those mirrors on the inside; the only downside is that what you see and what you get are slightly different. Now you might be thinking to yourself, \u2018Wait a minute, I have a digital point and shoot camera and I don\u2019t have that second lens,\u2019 and you\u2019re not wrong. I want to show you- this is the reason why I brought out this one- this is my digital point and shoot camera- it doesn\u2019t have that second lens, because all it has is the LCD screen on the back. Now a lot of camera makers took away that optical viewfinder and second lens when they started making really compact digital cameras, and for a while everybody thought it was super cool, but the downside is that in really sunny conditions this LCD screen can be really hard to see the picture so you don\u2019t really know what you\u2019re taking a picture of- so a lot of camera makers are actually going back to adding that optical viewfinder as well. In any event, I want you to remember point and shoot cameras traditionally have two lenses and that this is a single lens reflex camera. Point and shoot cameras are great because they are always smaller and they\u2019re easy to carry with you, single lens reflex cameras have lenses that you can change. Thanks for joining me! Have a great day! \"}}]}",

Remember that there are 3 types of infinitives: -ar, -er, -ir.  Infinitives have 2 parts: the stem (or beginning) and the ending.  Now, lets' take a look at what stem-changing is all about!\\n\\nStem-Changing Verbs\\nIn regular verbs, the stem doesn't change, only the ending changes as you conjugate in the different forms.  Take a look at this example with the -ar verb ESTUDIAR  (to study) in the present tense:\\n\\nyo\\t                               estudio\\nt\u00fa\\t                              estudias\\n\u00e9l/ella/Usted                     estudia\\nnosotros\\t                estudiamos\\nvosotros\\t               estudi\u00e1is\\nellos/ellas/Ustedes.\\testudian\\n\\nBut with some verbs, both the ending AND the stem change when you conjugate.  Of course, there are always exceptions to the rules, so make a note of this - the stem doesn't change when you conjugate in the NOSOTROS and VOSOTROS forms. Two less things to worry about!! \\n\\nIn the present tense, there are 3 groups of stem-changing verbs: e-ie, o-ue, and e-i. In this lesson, we will discuss the e-ie and o-ue stem-changing verbs.\\n\\nE-IE\\nIn these stem-changing verbs, the letter E in the stem changes to IE, except..... yep, you got it, except with NOSOTROS and VOSOTROS! Just checking to see if you're paying attention! Take a look at this example with the -ir verb PREFERIR (to prefer) in the present tense:\\n\\nyo\\t                 \\tprefiero\\nt\u00fa\\t                 \\tprefieres\\n\u00e9l/ella/Usted \\t\\tprefiere\\nellos/ellas/Ustedes.\\tprefieren\\nNOSOTROS            \\tpreferimos - NO STEM CHANGE\\nVOSOTROS            \\tprefer\u00eds - NO STEM CHANGE\\n\\nO-UE\\nIn these stem-changing verbs, the letter O in the stem changes to UE in all forms, except.... What did you say? Can you repeat that? \u00a1Exacto! In all forms, except NOSOTROS and VOSOTROS!! Take a look at this example with the -er verb VOLVER (to return) in the present tense:\\n\\nyo\\t                \\tvuelvo\\nt\u00fa\\t                \\tvuelves\\n\u00e9l/ella/Usted            \\t vuelve\\nellos/ellas/Ustedes\\tvuelven\\nNOSOTROS           \\t volvemos - NO STEM CHANGE\\nVOSOTROS            \\t volv\u00e9is - NO STEM CHANGE\\n\\nLearning the stem-changing verbs take a bit of practice (and memorization!), but you will become a stem-changing expert in no time!\\n\\n\"}},{\"type\":\"markdown\",\"data\":{\"text\":\"Now that we have gone over e-ie and o-ue stem-changing verbs, it's time to put into practice what you have learned!\\n\\nAssessment:\\n\\n1.

When you borrow money, you pay interest. When you lend money, you get paid interest. There is a simple formula for calculating interest: Principal Amount x Interest Rate x Amount of Time. The principal amount is the size of the loan. So our earlier example was 100 x .03 x 1 = $3. There is an important difference between the way you calculate simple versus compound interest.\\n\\nIn this story of credit cards, who is making your friend rich? You are! For example, if you borrow $1,000 and you have to pay 30% interest, then you are revenue for the credit company worth $300/year. No wonder he's the person everyone reaches out to!\\n\\nDo not open a credit card just to get a discount. Open an account because you have a plan for why you need the money, how you will use the money, and how you will pay the money back.

Banks will do the same thing to you that you just did to George, Samantha, and Simone. Banks will look at your history of paying back loans to see if they can trust you with their money.
